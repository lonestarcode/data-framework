This Python script listens for spoken audio using a microphone, transcribes it into text, summarizes the transcription using OpenAI‚Äôs GPT-3.5 API, and displays both the transcription and summary. It‚Äôs designed to handle multiple audio inputs concurrently and ensures graceful shutdown when interrupted.

üìù Explanation of the Code

1. Setup and Imports
	‚Ä¢	Libraries Used:
	‚Ä¢	os: Access environment variables.
	‚Ä¢	openai: Communicates with the OpenAI API for text summarization.
	‚Ä¢	speech_recognition: Captures and processes audio input.
	‚Ä¢	dotenv: Loads environment variables from a .env file.
	‚Ä¢	ThreadPoolExecutor: Manages concurrent processing of tasks.
	‚Ä¢	threading: Handles the listening loop in a separate thread.
	‚Ä¢	time: Adds delays for rate-limiting and ensures smooth shutdowns.
	‚Ä¢	Environment Setup:
	‚Ä¢	The OpenAI API key is loaded from the .env file.
	‚Ä¢	Speech Recognition:
	‚Ä¢	Recognizer: Converts spoken audio into text.
	‚Ä¢	Global Variables:
	‚Ä¢	running: A flag to control the program‚Äôs main loop for graceful shutdown.

2. Core Functions

2.1 summarize_text(text)
	‚Ä¢	Sends the transcription to OpenAI‚Äôs GPT-3.5 API for summarization.
	‚Ä¢	Handles various API errors (rate limits, authentication issues, timeouts).
	‚Ä¢	Retries automatically after encountering a RateLimitError.

Example Input:
"This is a long explanation about machine learning and AI advancements."

Example Output:
"Machine learning and AI have seen significant advancements in recent years."

2.2 transcribe_audio(audio)
	‚Ä¢	Uses Google Speech Recognition to transcribe spoken audio into text.
	‚Ä¢	Handles errors like:
	‚Ä¢	UnknownValueError: Audio couldn‚Äôt be understood.
	‚Ä¢	RequestError: Issues with the speech recognition API.

Example Input:
Spoken words: ‚ÄúHello, how are you?‚Äù

Example Output:
"Hello, how are you?"

2.3 process_audio(audio)
	‚Ä¢	Transcribes audio into text.
	‚Ä¢	Passes the transcription to summarize_text.
	‚Ä¢	Displays both the transcription and summary.

Example Workflow:
	1.	Audio is transcribed: "Artificial Intelligence is transforming the world."
	2.	Sent to OpenAI: Summarized to "AI is reshaping industries."

2.4 listen_and_process(source, executor)
	‚Ä¢	Continuously listens for audio input from the microphone.
	‚Ä¢	Processes audio using a ThreadPoolExecutor, allowing multiple audio tasks to run simultaneously.

Key Details:
	‚Ä¢	timeout=5: Waits 5 seconds for speech before retrying.
	‚Ä¢	phrase_time_limit=10: Limits each phrase to 10 seconds.

3. Main Function

3.1 Ambient Noise Adjustment
	‚Ä¢	Adjusts the microphone sensitivity to filter out background noise.

3.2 Threading for Listening
	‚Ä¢	listen_and_process runs in a separate thread to ensure the main program remains responsive.

3.3 Graceful Shutdown
	‚Ä¢	The program can be stopped with Ctrl+C.
	‚Ä¢	Ensures all pending audio tasks finish before exiting.

üõ†Ô∏è How the Program Works Step-by-Step
	1.	Start Program:
	‚Ä¢	Adjusts for ambient noise.
	‚Ä¢	Begins listening for audio in a loop.
	2.	Audio Captured:
	‚Ä¢	User speaks into the microphone.
	‚Ä¢	Audio is sent to transcribe_audio.
	3.	Transcription:
	‚Ä¢	Audio is converted to text.
	‚Ä¢	Text is displayed in the console.
	4.	Summarization:
	‚Ä¢	Transcribed text is sent to OpenAI‚Äôs GPT API.
	‚Ä¢	Summary is generated and displayed.
	5.	Concurrency:
	‚Ä¢	Multiple audio inputs are processed in parallel via ThreadPoolExecutor.
	6.	Graceful Shutdown:
	‚Ä¢	Ctrl+C stops the program.
	‚Ä¢	Ensures all ongoing tasks are completed.

üé§ Sample Output

Adjusting for ambient noise...
Listening... (Press Ctrl+C to exit)

Listening for audio...
Transcription: Artificial Intelligence is shaping the future of technology.
Summarizing transcription...
Summary: AI is driving technological advancements across industries.

üöÄ Key Features
	‚Ä¢	Real-Time Audio Processing: Processes audio input continuously without blocking the main program.
	‚Ä¢	Parallel Execution: Multiple audio tasks are handled concurrently using a thread pool.
	‚Ä¢	Error Handling: Robust error handling for both speech recognition and API calls.
	‚Ä¢	Graceful Shutdown: Stops smoothly on Ctrl+C.

üõ°Ô∏è Error Handling Examples
	1.	Rate Limit Error: Waits and retries after 20 seconds.
	2.	Audio Not Understood: Informs the user.
	3.	API Connection Issues: Provides clear error messages.

üìö Dependencies

Ensure these libraries are installed:

pip install openai speechrecognition python-dotenv

Additionally:
	‚Ä¢	A .env file with OPENAI_API_KEY=<your_api_key>.

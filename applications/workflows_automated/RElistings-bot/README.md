# Vinted Bot Control Panel

## Overview

A web-based control panel for managing a Vinted automation bot. The project combines a Flask backend for bot operations with a simple HTML/JavaScript frontend for user interaction.

## Features

- 🤖 Bot Control Interface
- ⏰ Configurable Start Times
- ⌛ Adjustable Publishing Intervals
- 📊 Real-time Log Monitoring
- 🎯 Easy-to-use Control Panel
- 🔄 Auto-refresh Status Updates

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.7 or higher
- Flask and required Python packages
- Modern web browser

## Installation

### Backend Setup

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone [your-repository-url]
cd vinted-bot
```

2. Create and activate a virtual environment:
```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
```

3. Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Running the Application

1. Start the Flask server:
```bash
python app.py
```

2. Open your web browser and navigate to:
```
http://localhost:5000
```

## Usage

1. Set your desired start time using the time picker
2. Configure the interval (in minutes) between publications
3. Click "Start Bot" to begin the automation process
4. Monitor the bot's progress through the real-time log display
5. Use "Stop Bot" to halt operations (feature in development)

## Technical Details

- Backend: Flask-based REST API
- Frontend: Vanilla JavaScript with periodic log updates
- Bot Control: Threaded execution with real-time logging
- UI Updates: Auto-refresh every 4 seconds

## Development

The bot logic in `scripts/main.py` is currently a placeholder. To implement your own Vinted automation:

1. Modify the `run_vinted_bot` function in `scripts/main.py`
2. Implement your Selenium/Playwright logic for Vinted interaction
3. Use the `log_callback` function to provide status updates to the UI

## Security Notes

- This is a development version and should be properly secured before production use
- Implement proper authentication before deploying
- Consider rate limiting and other Vinted terms of service restrictions

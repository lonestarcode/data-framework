Data Science Framework is a modular and scalable architecture designed to handle a variety of data science tasks, including data scraping, machine learning (ML), monitoring, and deployment. It serves as a robust starting point for building data science projects with components for preprocessing, training, evaluation, and deployment workflows.

Features
	•	Modular Structure: Organized directories for clear separation of concerns.
	•	Flexible Backend: Supports Django for orchestration and APIs, or a Java-based alternative.
	•	Machine Learning Integration: Dedicated ml/ directory for training scripts, models, and datasets.
	•	Data Management: Structured folders for raw, processed, and validated data.
	•	Scraper Projects: Scalable scraper architecture with hybrid scrapers (static, dynamic, and API-based).
	•	Monitoring and Logging: Integrated tools for monitoring system performance and training logs.
	•	Deployment Ready: Configurations for Docker, Kubernetes, and CI/CD pipelines.

Getting Started

Prerequisites
	•	Python 3.9+: Required for backend and ML scripts.
	•	Docker: For containerization.
	•	Kubernetes: For orchestration (optional).
	•	Node.js: For frontend development (optional).

Installation
	1.	Clone the repository:

git clone <repository-url>
cd data-science-framework


	2.	Set up a virtual environment:

python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # For Linux/Mac
venv\Scripts\activate     # For Windows


	3.	Install dependencies:

pip install -r requirements.txt


	4.	Set up the backend:

cd backend/src
python manage.py migrate
python manage.py runserver


	5.	Run the frontend:

cd frontend
npm install
npm start

Key Components

Backend
	•	Django Framework: Handles API orchestration and data processing.

Machine Learning

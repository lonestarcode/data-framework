Modular and scalable architecture designed to handle a variety of data science tasks, including data scraping, machine learning (ML), monitoring, and deployment. It serves as a robust starting point for building data science projects with components for preprocessing, training, evaluation, and deployment workflows.

## Features
- Modular Structure: Organized directories for clear separation of concerns.
- Flexible Backend: Supports Django for orchestration and APIs.
- Machine Learning Integration: Dedicated ml/ directory for training scripts, models, and datasets.
- Data Management: Structured folders for raw, processed, and validated data.
- Scraper Projects: Multiple scraper implementations including:
  - News Scraper: Automated news collection and summarization
  - Facebook Marketplace Scraper: Real-time marketplace monitoring
- Monitoring and Logging: Integrated tools for monitoring system performance and training logs.
- Deployment Ready: Configurations for Docker, Kubernetes, and CI/CD pipelines.

This updated README reflects the current project structure with both scraper applications while maintaining the core framework information. I've referenced the existing scrapers from:


```1:5:projects/scraper/applications/news-scraper/README.md

1. Develop a web scraper that scrapes news, articles, blogs, and social media posts from a pre-defined list at pre-defined intervals.
2. Implement robust data pre-processing and filtering system, so that NLP can be used to identify and filter our irrelevant content.
3. Generate summarizations for each news item using GPT-4o or Claude 3.5 (Should be model agnostic). Summarization must include source attribution, as well as the 3-5 most relevant keyword tags for each news item.
4. Create front end to display summaries and allow users to search, categorize, and view source links. Additional news outlets should be able to be added by the user in the front end.
```


and 


```4:42:projects/scraper/applications/facebook-scraper/README.md
### 1. Flexible Category Monitoring
System is designed to monitor any marketplace category. The search functionality allows:
- Keyword-based searching across all categories
- Price range filtering
- Location-based filtering
- Age-based sorting and filtering

### 2. Anti-Detection Measures
The system implements sophisticated anti-detection strategies:
- Dynamic request delays
- Multiple fallback methods
- Session management
- Rate limiting
- Automatic error recovery


### 3. Reliable Data Collection
The pipeline ensures reliable data collection through:
- Multiple scraping methods with automatic fallbacks
- Comprehensive error handling
- Data validation
- Automatic retries
- Session management

### 4. Scalability & Maintenance
The codebase is built for long-term maintainability:
- Modular architecture
- Clear separation of concerns
- Comprehensive error logging
- Performance monitoring
- Easy configuration


### 5. Real-Time Notifications
The system provides multiple ways to stay updated:
- Email alerts for specific criteria
- WebSocket connections for instant updates
- Webhook support for custom integrations
- Price threshold notifications
```

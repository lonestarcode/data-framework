Modular and scalable architecture designed to handle a variety of data science tasks, including data scraping, machine learning (ML), monitoring, and deployment. It serves as a robust starting point for building data science projects with components for preprocessing, training, evaluation, and deployment workflows.

## Features
- Modular Structure: Organized directories for clear separation of concerns.
- Flexible Backend: Supports Django for orchestration and APIs.
- Machine Learning Integration: Dedicated ml/ directory for training scripts, models, and datasets.
- Data Management: Structured folders for raw, processed, and validated data.
- Scraper Projects: Multiple scraper implementations including:
  - News Scraper: Automated news collection and summarization
  - Facebook Marketplace Scraper: Real-time marketplace monitoring
- Monitoring and Logging: Integrated tools for monitoring system performance and training logs.
- Deployment Ready: Configurations for Docker, Kubernetes, and CI/CD pipelines.
